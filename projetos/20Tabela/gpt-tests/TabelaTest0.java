package ds;Here are some test cases for the Tabela Java class:

1. Test case for pesquisa() method:
- Create a Tabela object.
- Create an Item object.
- Insert the Item object into the Tabela object.
- Call the pesquisa() method with the Item object as the parameter.
- Assert that the return value is the index of the Item object in the Tabela object.

2. Test case for insere() method:
- Create a Tabela object.
- Create an Item object.
- Call the insere() method with the Item object as the parameter.
- Assert that the Tabela object contains the Item object at the last index.

3. Test case for binaria() method:
- Create a Tabela object.
- Create an Item object.
- Insert multiple Item objects into the Tabela object in sorted order.
- Call the binaria() method with the Item object as the parameter.
- Assert that the return value is the index of the Item object in the Tabela object.

Note: These are just basic test cases to get you started. You may need to add more test cases to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
