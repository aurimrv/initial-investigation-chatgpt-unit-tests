package ds;Here are some test cases for the AvaliaMultMatrizes Java class:

1. Test case for multiplying matrices with n = 0:
   - Input: n = 0, d = []
   - Expected output: No output, as there are no matrices to multiply.

2. Test case for multiplying matrices with n = 1:
   - Input: n = 1, d = [1]
   - Expected output: No output, as there is only one matrix.

3. Test case for multiplying matrices with n = 2:
   - Input: n = 2, d = [1, 2, 3]
   - Expected output: No output, as there are only two matrices.

4. Test case for multiplying matrices with n = 3:
   - Input: n = 3, d = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   - Expected output: The program should print the minimum cost of multiplying the matrices.

5. Test case for multiplying matrices with n = 4:
   - Input: n = 4, d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Expected output: The program should print the minimum cost of multiplying the matrices.

Note: Since the AvaliaMultMatrizes class does not have any return value or side effects, the expected output for the test cases is based on the print statements within the method.
