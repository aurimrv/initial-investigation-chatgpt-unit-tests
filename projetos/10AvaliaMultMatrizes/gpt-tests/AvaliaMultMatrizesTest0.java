package ds;Here are some test cases for the AvaliaMultMatrizes Java class:

1. Test case for n = 0:
   - Input: n = 0, d = []
   - Expected output: No output, since there are no matrices to multiply.

2. Test case for n = 1:
   - Input: n = 1, d = [3]
   - Expected output: No output, since there is only one matrix.

3. Test case for n = 2:
   - Input: n = 2, d = [2, 3]
   - Expected output: Print the calculated value of m[1][2].

4. Test case for n = 3:
   - Input: n = 3, d = [2, 3, 4]
   - Expected output: Print the calculated values of m[1][2], m[2][3], and m[1][3].

5. Test case for n = 4:
   - Input: n = 4, d = [2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Expected output: Print the calculated values of m[1][2], m[2][3], m[3][4], m[1][3], m[2][4], and m[1][4].

Note: Since the provided code only contains a method for matrix multiplication, the test cases focus on different values of n and d. The expected output is not specified, as it is dependent on the implementation of the method and the specific values of n and d.
