package ds;Here are some test cases for the AvaliaMultMatrizes Java class:

1. Test case for n = 0 and d = []
   - Input: n = 0, d = []
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
2. Test case for n = 1 and d = [5]
   - Input: n = 1, d = [5]
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
3. Test case for n = 2 and d = [2, 3]
   - Input: n = 2, d = [2, 3]
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
4. Test case for n = 3 and d = [2, 3, 4]
   - Input: n = 3, d = [2, 3, 4]
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
5. Test case for n = 3 and d = [2, -3, 4]
   - Input: n = 3, d = [2, -3, 4]
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
6. Test case for n = 3 and d = [2, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 4]
   - Input: n = 3, d = [2, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 4]
   - Expected output: No exception should be thrown
  
7. Test case for n = -3 and d = [2, 3, 4]
   - Input: n = -3, d = [2, 3, 4]
   - Expected output: IllegalArgumentException should be thrown
  
8. Test case for n = 3 and d = null
   - Input: n = 3, d = null
   - Expected output: NullPointerException should be thrown
