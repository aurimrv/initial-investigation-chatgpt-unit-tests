package ds;Here are some test cases for the AvaliaMultMatrizes class:

1. Test case for n = 0:
- Input: n = 0, d = []
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

2. Test case for n = 1:
- Input: n = 1, d = [1]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

3. Test case for n = 2:
- Input: n = 2, d = [1, 2]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

4. Test case for n = 3:
- Input: n = 3, d = [1, 2, 3]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

5. Test case for n = 4:
- Input: n = 4, d = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

6. Test case for n = 5:
- Input: n = 5, d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

7. Test case for n = 10:
- Input: n = 10, d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

8. Test case for n = 100:
- Input: n = 100, d = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

9. Test case for n = 1000:
- Input: n = 1000, d = [1, 2, 3, ..., 1000]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

10. Test case for n = 10000:
- Input: n = 10000, d = [1, 2, 3, ..., 10000]
- Expected output: No exception should be thrown

Note: These test cases only check for exceptions. They do not verify the correctness of the output. To test the correctness of the output, additional test cases would need to be created.
